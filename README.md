# FriendJournal

This app allows me to keep collections of memories shared with those that truly matter. It allows me to create
entries of friends and note particular events we shared. 

It's a full-stack app that uses React for the front-end and MongoDB, NodeJS and Express for the back-end. 

## To run on your local machine

After cloning the repository, create a new MongoDB cluster and add the mongoURI to default.json. 

To run server:

```bash
npm run dev     
```
